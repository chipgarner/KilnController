# well with the simulated oven. You must tune them to work well with
# your specific kiln. Note that the integral pid_ki is
# inverted so that a smaller number means more integral action.
# Marks earlier values

# My notes from July 18 burn:
# I have continual oscillations until the system canâ€™t keep up with the target temp.
# At top temp I never reach the target temp, always 2C under.

# If you have oscillations that don't stop or increase in size, reduce pid_kp
# If you have an oscillation but the temperature is mostly below the setpoint, decrease pid_ki.
